# SMART MEDICINE INVENTORY AND DEMAND OPTIMIZATION SYSTEM

## 1. Overview

This project is a PL/SQL-based system designed to help pharmacies and hospitals manage medicines in a smarter and safer way.  
The system tracks stock levels, shows alerts when drugs are running out or nearing expiry, and predicts future medicine demand based on historical data.  
This reduces waste, prevents stock shortages, and protects patients from consuming expired medicines.  
The project uses PL/SQL features such as procedures, triggers, functions, and cursors to automate most operations.

## 3. PL/SQL Features Applied

- **Stored Procedures:** Used for registering medicines, updating records, and generating reports  
- **Triggers:** Automatically update stock after every transaction and enforce business rules  
- **Functions:** Used to calculate predicted demand and other system logic  
- **Cursors:** Used to scan stock, batches, and expiry information  
- **Packages:** Organize related procedures and functions together  
- **Exception Handling:** Handles errors safely and clearly
